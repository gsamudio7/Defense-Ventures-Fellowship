## SKOPE Slide Template

- These slides provide an overview that demonstrate several features
- Use background slides
- Present bullets incrementally
- Embed graphics

### Notes
- Once you generate the markdown file there are several useful GAP/Skope graphics in directory 'assets/images'
- If you are operating on a windows operating system change line 16 to '- assets/static/custom_windows.css' 

### Note: when you generate the slide deck there is a directory with useful graphics files at 'assets/images/'

"Data in the 21st Century is like Oil in the 18th Century: an immensely, untapped valuable asset. Like oil, for those who see Dataâ€™s fundamental value and learn to extract and use it there will be huge rewards."

"More often than not, companies are not ready for AI. Maybe they hired their first data scientist to less-than-stellar outcomes, or maybe data literacy is not central to their culture. But the most common scenario is that they have not yet built the infrastructure to implement (and reap the benefits of) the most basic data science algorithms and operations, much less machine learning."
